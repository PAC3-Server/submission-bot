# WIP Discord Submission Bot

### What does this Bot do?
Submits an URI (for example a youtube video) or a file to a channel on Discord, think of it like a Showcase Channel, where people can show off their work.

### Can I add this bot to my server?
Not as of yet, but this bot is supposed to be public and for anyone to use, keep an eye out for the "Add to Server" button on Discord or updates here on the repo.
